# We have a new Documentation Portal!

Since the new version of the application has been officially released and successfully rolled out to all of our users, we thought it was time to update our documentation...

<!--truncate-->

Apart from the documentation itself, we've decided to change the platform we use to host it to make it more accessible and user-friendly.

In this new portal you can expect to find:
- Documentation: We have documented and explained the most relevant concepts, features, and app screens. With a quick read of any of the documentation sections, you will be able to comprehend what our apps can offer and how we recommend using it.
- Guides: A set of comprehensive and role-specific guides and tutorials to help you get the most out of BonusBank.
- News: This brand new section, where we will be posting the latest news about our application.


We are constantly working to improve our customers experience and love hearing from you.

Feel free to [contact us](/docs/doc-contact-us) to have a chat about how we can continue improving.

Best Regards,
The BonusBank Team
