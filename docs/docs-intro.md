# Introduction to the BonusBank App

<p align="center">
Hello! We welcome you to this info series where you will discover everything about BonusBank: from downloading the App, to all functionalities and how to become an authentic expert in Tokenization. Shall we begin?
</p>

### What is BonusBank?

Our first question of this discovery journey; and here is the answer: **BonusBank** helps organizations give **feedback**, **recognition**, **incentives** and **rewards on a continuous basis**. It is an important tool for organizations to **improve** the **employee experience and performance management**, thanks to the use of Tokenization (we'll talk about **Tokenization** later).

We know you may have a lot of questions, and we're going to answer them little by little.

Let's first talk about what the **BonusBank** Software consists of:

1. An **APP** (Android and iOS, and the web version) to send and receive feedback, recognition, rewards, incentives and evaluations in a business environment. This application enables **instant**, **flexible** and **transparent** transfers of Tokens between and within the different teams in an organization

2. A **dashboard** that analyzes transaction data for the purpose of creating profiles of employees based on their capabilities and to understand the relationships within the organization

### What can we do?

Within BonusBank you can carry out **2 actions**:

1. **Recognition**. Send Tokens to recognize the skills and abilities of your colleagues or employees or simply to thank or congratulate them

2. **Incentive**. Incentivize your employees by sending Tokens associated with monetary rewards, such as: prizes, money, company shares...

If you want to know more about the 2 types of reward (Recognition and Incentive), we recommend to read [this information item](http://localhost:3000/docs/general-info/general-transfers). 

In order to be able to carry out these two actions, it is necessary to create a Plan beforehand. Plans are Token-related periods where people can send specific Tokens. If you want to know more about Plans, how to create them and the types that exist, see [this information item](http://localhost:3000/docs/general-info/schedules).


Now that you know what BonusBank is for, we will explain what you need to do to access the App and the Dashboard.

### The App

### Dashboard

<p align="center"><img src={require('./general-info/img/combo-new-screens.png').default} alt="drawing" text-align="center"/></p>

To access the <strong>dashboard</strong> of BonusBank, you must meet two conditions:<br></br>
  1. Your organization has an agreement with BonusBank.<br></br>
  2. You are a manager or have a managerial position within the company.<br></br><br></br>


If so, you are almost able to enjoy the full experience. Unfortunately, the dashboard is <strong>not available to everyone</strong> as it reflects user stats (unique to each organization) that not everyone will access to.<br></br><strong>Discover your role</strong> and we'll let you know if you can enjoy the management panel!<br></br>
