# Let's Act III: Goals

## It's time for action: Goals

#### After the introduction about Tokens in the previous info item, we´ll now find out how to use Goals, how to create them and what the different options are.

As leaders, managers or admins, we can define two useful actions within BonusBank: **Goals**. These are tools available through the app's floating button (via the "Define" option) that allow us to make our **Teams participate in the transfer decisions of Tokens**, and help us **set common objectives**.

Below we explain in more detail what each of these actions consists of.

### What is a Goal and why do we use it

Essentially we could say that a **goal is a collective challenge**.

The challenge is to get a certain number of tokens (of a type or a version). This is calculated as a flow when it is about tokens flowing through a Space or through the team members' accounts. However, the Goal can also be to get a specific number of tokens of a type or version. In that case you see the number of collected tokens and not the amount that came through the accounts.

So a goal is associated with receiving or sending a certain number of Tokens within a certain period (with a possible periodicity) by a group of employees of the company (or all).

Now that we know how it works, the question is why goals exist. Every company has their reasons, but if we had to name three reasons, they would be:

- **Encourage and promote the sending of tokens**. Initially it is important to motivate the teams to send each other tokens, to start using the app and to create an environment of constant feedback.
- **Improve skills**. Soft Tokens are generally associated with skills that team members can improve. So they get such tokens when they try their best and show that they have the skill. So reception implies an **improvement** in the required skills. By defining a Goal, you challenge them to work on the skills and reach the target number of tokens for that skill.
- **Team spirit**. It is good to improve individually, but on a collective level it is just as important. The Goals ensure that all professionals within a team have a **common goal** to strive for, talk about and contribute to. They have to do it together!

And you? What benefits do you see in the Goals?

## How can I define a Goal?

Now, we explain graphically and intuitively **how** you **can define a Goal** within BonusBank.

The way to access this option is **through the side menu** of the app or via the **floating button** and choosing the "**Define**" option; once there it's as simple as **selecting** the option "**goal**" and then you get to a screen where, in case no Goal has been created (as in the examples we show below the explanation), it informs you that there are no Goals to show. **Above on the top right** you'll be able **to create** a Goal using the **"+" option.**

<img src={require('./img/missionscreate.png').default} alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Once you have defined a Goal, it will appear on the screen on the right where you can see it title, the details of **participants**, the **start and end dates** and its **progress** (number of received or sent tokens related to the set target). You can consult more information such as the latest transfers that are related to the Goal.

Back to the creation process: you selected the **"+"** and automatically go to a screen in which we have to fill in a series of **fields**. Below you see a real case where you can see what information you can fill in in each field to define the Goal:

<img src={require('./img/missionsedit.png').default} alt="drawing" width="300"/>

First, we must define whether the Goal is going to be **for a specific Team or global** (that is, for the entire Space or company). Next, we assign a **title** and give a clear **description** of the Goal so that everyone can understand what it consists of. After completing these basic fields, it is time to add the details:

<img src={require('./img/missionseditstep2.png').default} alt="drawing" width="500"/>

As can be seen, the next field you need to indicate what you **want to measure and have as an indicator** of the extent to which the Goal is being accomplished, choosing from three possibilities:

- We can select to measure the **total flow of all the Tokens available** at the Space or Team level ( depending on who gets the Goal)
- We can decide that only **the flow of one type of Token is measured** (such as Social or Profit, about which we talk in this info item)
- Or we only measure **the flow of a specific Token**.

In the case of Example shown, the third option has been selected (the Creativity Token, derived from the Token type "Expertise").

To finish defining what we want to measure, it is necessary to choose the **type of flow: Tokens sent or Tokens received**. In the case shown, the Goal consists of the entire Team receiving a series of Creative Tokens. How many? That is the next completed field and we can see that it is 100.

Finally, we can **decide** if we want this Goal to **be repeated periodically or not**; In the case of repeating it, we will simply have to mark the periodicity (eg: every 2 months, every 3 weeks, every 5 days ...). In this case it is a specific one-off Goal and that’s why it shows an end date.
