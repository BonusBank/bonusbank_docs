# Let's Act IV: Sendings

## It's time for the fourth action: the Sendings

#### This is the last type of action. Find out which Sendings can be made, how we can do them or what the possible restrictions are.

## What types of sendings exist?

Currently there are 3 types of sendings possible in **BonusBank**:

- **Recognition**. Send Tokens as a sign of **recognition** for the **skills** and **abilities** of your colleagues or employees or simply to **thank or congratulate them**.

- **Reward**. **Incentivize** your employees by sending **Tokens** associated with **future monetary rewards**, such as: prizes, money, company shares ...

- **Challenge**. This third action allows you to **set an objective for** one or more people: when they meet it, they will receive the promised Tokens

Below, in **"how to do a transfer?"** We elaborate step by step on how you can send a sign of recognition, a reward or launch a challenge within the App. So please note that **Recognition** and **Rewards** imply an **instant transfer** of Tokens: you select the recipient or recipients and the token you want to send, as well as the quantity and the message you add. Once ready and confirmed, the amount is immediately transferred to the other account(s).

In the case of the **Challenge**, you **launch a challenge** to one or more colleagues by filling in the same fields as in Recognition and Reward, plus: the objective and its deadline. Once you have launched the Challenge, the recipient(s) will be asked to **accept it** (they have the option to decline) and that's when the countdown begins. The Challenge will have to be completed before the deadline in which case the tokens will be claimed by the recipient marking **it as completed**. After your confirmation as challenger, the tokens will be transferred. So if, instead of being the challenger you are challenged yourself, you know what to expect!

In summary , this logic is followed by the **two types of transfers** within BonusBank:

1. **RECOGNITION AND REWARD**: Sender sends tokens - Recipient receives tokens
2. **CHALLENGE**: Sender launches challenge - Recipient accepts - Deadline - Recipient claims tokens after completion - Sender confirms completion (if the Challenge declines or the not meeting the deadline, not all steps will be performed)

### Transfer Limits

Yes, unfortunately you can not always send all the tokens when and to whom you want. This because there are some rules set during **the token configuration** by its creator (owner, managers or executives; see this information item for more about roles). The limits exist **to foster relationships between as many teammates as possible** and prevent injustice or individualism.

We can divide the limits into **3 broad categories**:

- **Quantity**. There are certain restrictions possible on the **number of tokens that can be sent** and these are:

  - **Maximum 'X' tokens per 'Y' days**. Some tokens are configured in such a way that only a maximum number **per day, week and even month can be sent**. So be careful (the limit is stated in the description of the token) and don't accidentally send the quota for the whole month in one go!

  - **Maximum X Tokens in a single shipment**. When trying to send more than the maximum, we get an error in case of Tokens which are **limited by quantity** (note that info about the limit can be found in the token details)

- **Frequency**. Each company can decide for itself which logic to apply, for example one depending on each team (larger or smaller, more or less interconnected ...). To **prevent that Token X always goes to the same person (nepotism)**, it can be determined that shipments may only be repeated after first sending **the same token to a specified number of other colleagues**. For example, if you have sent a punctuality token to María and it has been determined that 2 transfers of this token must first be made to others, then we can send a punctuality token to e.g. Jan and Cristina before we can reward María again (with that specific token, but we can of course send her other tokens that we have in our account)

- **Rol**. This is a functionality that is also defined when creating the Token. There are 2 options here: either **only Members can receive the Tokens** (i.e. not the Team Leaders, Managers, Administrators and Owners) **or everyone can receive them**.

### How to do a transfer?

Now we explain in a graphical and intuitive way **how to** make a transfer. Please note that there are 2 types!

The way to access this option is **via the floating button** that appears on the App's four main screens at all times. Once pressed, it's as simple as **selecting** the option **"Send"** and then you'll be taken to a **screen** where you'll see the **three options** we've already talked about: the (instant) Recognition and Rewards, and the (conditional) Challenge.

Now that we have reached a choice, let’s start with Recognition and Reward because they work the same way but do not feature the same type of tokens (Soft tokens for recognition and hard tokens for rewards).

Here we show a real case with the information that needed to complete each field in order to send a Reward within BonusBank:

<img src={require('./img/transfersschedule.png').default} alt="drawing" width="300"/>

The first step is to **choose the member(s)** that should receive the token that we want to transfer. We may want to check the total number of tokens available to send. In the example image, there are 3 tokens that can be sent as a leader (our role as a leader can be identified by the blue circle around the photo and the text between brackets next to the token type). In case you are not a leader but only a member, you will see the available tokens that can be sent as a member.

Once it is clear which token we want to send, all we have to do is click on the green **"Choose" button** and then we will go to the next screen.

<img src={require('./img/transfersuser.png').default} alt="drawing" width="300"/>

In this example, we will choose Creativity Tokens (belonging to the Expertise type of the Initial Pack, which you can read more about in this info item).

<img src={require('./img/transfersfinaldetails.png').default} alt="drawing" width="300"/>

It's time to decide **how many Tokens** we'll send and **to add a unique and personal message**. As a final step, we can **decide** whether the **transfer will be publicly** visible (this is only requested for certain types of Token, because many are always private). Don't forget to press the **"transfer tokens"** button. It's that simple!

Super. Hopefully it is now clear how to send Reward Tokens (and in the same way Recognition ones). It's time for one of the coolest actions at BonusBank: the **Challenge**. It is very similar to a normal transfer, so let's first see the 3 screens together because you will see the difference later:

<img src={require('./img/transfersoverview.png').default} alt="drawing" width="650"/>

First **we select the person(s)** we want to challenge, afterwards the **Token** we want to use, plus the **number of Tokens** that will be sent as a reward and the **deadline we give**. Don´t forget the **message**! You have to provide a good description of the challenge otherwise it will not work. Note that you will get the option to make the challenge proposal public in the Social Feed.

After launching the Challenge, the **recipient** gets a notification with the request to decide to **accept or reject** it. When the challenge starts, one of these** two screens is added to our app automatically**: the **Confirmation**-screen or the **Claim**-screen.

**Via the floating action** button that is used to perform the two types of transfers, the person who was challenged can access the "Claim" screen: like the third here under this explanation. On it, in green we see those challenges that we have yet to complete (with the option to let the challenger know it's done), and without the green mark, we see what we've already completed but is still waiting for approval.

If on the other hand we were the one who **launched the Challenge**, we see the "**Confirm**" button to access a screen like the second one shown here. In green we see the challenges that have been completed and that we have yet need to confirm, and without green the challenges that we have launched and are still waiting to be completed.

<img src={require('./img/challengesoverview.png').default} alt="drawing" width="650"/>

And with these three types of Transfers, we close the chapter of the 4 BonusBank actions. Now it's time to talk about the 4 main screens of the app. They reflect the result of all actions.
