# The logic behind BonusBank Teams

<p align="center">We’ll explain their function within a Space in BonusBank, as well as what they can represent and what we find within each one of them </p>

### What is is a Team and what is it for

:::note Teams

A **team** is a **subspace** for groups within a **company** (the Space), and configured according to its criteria, **with private access to information about its** Tokens, transfers or goals (among others).

:::

Let's explain the previous sentence in some detail and clarify the role of Teams in BonusBank:

- **A subspace**. We start from the highest level with one or more **Spaces**, within which the **next level of segmentation** is **Teams**. We can therefore define Teams as subspaces of a Space, made up of small groups of the total number of people in the Space.

- **Configured according to company criteria**. BonusBank is useful for both traditional and more agile companies. For this reason, **Teams can be departments** (for organizations with a more traditional org chart), or **squads and tribes** (for entities that run agile methodologies) and **specific work groups** for certain projects. The **flexibility** with which the Team creation logic has been developed allows any type of methodology to fit into BonusBank.

- **Private access to information**. That's right, like in Spaces where people in one can’t see the information of those in another one, **the information generated within a Team will not be visible by other Teams**, even though they share the same Space. Therefore, you can have common goals or Tokens at the Space level, but those that are specific to a Team will only be visible to its members.

Thus, we can see how the **creation of Teams** will allow us to have a **greater granularity** when measuring and monitoring the progress of the professionals that make up the organization, and **facilitate** the **processes** of recognizing, motivating or incentivizing both our colleagues and employees. For managers it will be very important to have this degree of detail to be able to **assess specific groups** of people or simply to **find information more easily** when they want to recognize someone or launch an individual Goal.

### Where to find my Team(s) in the App

If you want to see the Team(s) you belong to, you can do it **through the side menu** of the application: either **directly by** selecting the option **"My Teams"**, or **indirectly by** selecting **"Space"** and within this screen by clicking on the number of Team(s). Below you will find a representation of the screens to help you understand how to get there and what you can see inside the App:

With this, we already know how to create an account in BonusBank, what is a Space and a Team, let's go on to discover the different roles within the App?
