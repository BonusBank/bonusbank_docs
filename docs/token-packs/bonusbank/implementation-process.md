# The implementation process

The **implementation process** of different **Token Packs** follow a similar logic. To help you understand it, we will illustrate this process with the Initial Token package (the starters pack).

:::note "
> ## " BonusBank serves SMEs, Startups / Scaleups and Enterprises
:::

**BonusBank** serves **three** major business **segments**:

- **Traditional SMEs**. Organizations of approximately 10 to 250 employees, primarily focused on providing **incentives** and **monetary rewards**, or bonuses, to their employees. They are aware of the importance of being able to offer something at the right moment throughout the year and of rewarding every step towards a goal. They want to continuously motivate their best employees and to continuously show the progress of their actions, and not just once a year.
- **Agile Startups, Scaleups and the modern SME**. We also refer to companies with between 10 and 250 employees, where good** team work** is the **main asset**. They work in **agile** and changing teams that are formed for a project or challenge. They prefer to focus on what they call peer-to-peer recognition in order to generate **intrinsic motivation**. They need a tool to facilitate mutual recognition among colleagues (at both the team and company level) and measure the _soft skills_ of every professional and team. In addition, often they are also interested in offering shares to their best talent and for this they look for a fair way to allocate such rights, based on the effort and results.
- **Large enterprises**. Companies with more than 250 professionals, looking for a way to give instant feedback, recognition or rewards and in **need** of **organizational change** in an effort to become **more agile**. These are companies that already work (to a greater or lesser extent) with agile teams and that want to know how these teams, and every person within them, function; and this not only on a performance level, but also in the development of their _soft skills_. The HR software most commonly used by these companies in general does not allow for immediate rewards and recognition that can be converted into tangible value at a later date. Therefore, BonusBank works as a "layer on top" of such software and will be available in their marketplaces in order to facilitate the integrated use of BonusBank.

Looking in more detail at the needs of the 3 segments mentioned above, we see how some may be more interested in Hard Tokens and others in Soft Tokens(as defined in the Introduction).

:::note "
> ### The Initial Pack is a general Token Pack that responds to all possible needs of the above-mentioned market segments.
:::

:::note "
> ### It consists of 5 types of token: Recognition, Expertise, RSC, Bonus and Profit
:::

The **first two** have no concrete value and are therefore more like **Soft Tokens** (despite the fact that the Expertise Tokens can be linked to Tokens for financial incentives, as described in the next chapter); the **third** (RSC) is a **hybrid** of both types, and the **last two** (Bonus and Profit) are what we call **Hard Tokens** because they represent tangible bonuses and monetary rewards.

In order for any kind of organization to be able to start with **Tokens**, we have made a starter package. It is a **general solution** that allows you to **measure** the **3 dimensions** of persons and teams (social, performance and competence), and to start with 1 or 2 specific token types and then scale when all have been tried. Each company can then develop its own model of Hard, Soft and Hybrid tokens.

There will also be many organizations with their own very well-defined evaluation method and activities, and who know how to translate their KPIs or OKRs into Tokens. In such a case, we offer a bespoke **Token Pack** with a more detailed and personalized set of tokens. This may depends on the segment, sector, profile and average age of the employees or the company culture.

:::note "
> ### With the Initial Pack we get a better understanding of how the application works, we get to know the three dimensions of Tokens and we immediately have a workable solution
:::

Using the **Initial Pack** has many **advantages**: we get a better understanding of how the application works, we learn the 3 dimensions of Tokens (social, performance and competence) and we immediately have a workable solutionâ€¦. And from there we can supplement it with other Packs developed by **BonusBank** or one of its partners, or one can develop our own Token Pack and thus reach **the next level**.
