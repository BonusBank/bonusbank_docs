# The implementation process

The **implementation process** of different **Token Packs** follow a similar logic. To help you understand it, we will illustrate this process with the BonusBank Token packs.

> ## BonusBank serves SMEs, Startups / Scaleups and Enterprises

**BonusBank** serves **three** major business **segments**:

- **Traditional SMEs**. Organizations of approximately 10 to 250 employees, primarily focused on providing **incentives** and **monetary rewards**, or bonuses, to their employees. They are aware of the importance of being able to offer something at the right moment throughout the year and of rewarding every step towards a goal. They want to continuously motivate their best employees and to continuously show the progress of their actions, and not just once a year.

- **Agile Startups, Scaleups and modern SMEs**. We also refer to companies with 10 to 250 employees, where good **team work** is the **main asset**. They work in **agile** and changing teams that are formed for a project or Goal. They prefer to focus on what they call peer-to-peer recognition in order to generate **intrinsic motivation**. They need a tool to facilitate mutual recognition among colleagues (at both the team and company level) and measure the _soft skills_ of every professional and team. In addition, often they are also interested in offering shares to their best talent and for this they look for a fair way to allocate such rights, based on the effort and results.

- **Large enterprises**. Companies with more than 250 professionals, looking for a way to give instant feedback, recognition or rewards and in **need** of **organizational change** in an effort to become **more agile**. These are companies that already work (to a greater or lesser extent) with agile teams and that want to know how these teams, and every person within them, function; and this not only on a performance level, but also in the development of their _soft skills_. The HR software most commonly used by these companies in general does not allow for immediate rewards and recognition that can be converted into tangible value at a later date.

Looking in more detail at the needs of the 3 segments mentioned above, we see how some may be more interested in one Token Pack or other (or maybe more than one).

> ### The 3 BB Token Packs are a general solution that respond to all possible needs of the above-mentioned market segments.

Under the names **Impulse, Feedback and Incentives Plus**, 3 solutions have been created to meet the different needs of an organisation.

> ### It consists of 7 Token categories (28 Tokens): Rewards, CSR, Executing, Bonifications, Influencing, Relationship Building and Strategic Thinking

The first one, Impulse, gives the option to **recognize typical day-to-day performance tasks**, such as: compliance, responsibility, punctuality... As well as **delivering bonuses** to employees in a more agile way.
It is a proposal designed for those more traditional SMEs to enter this world, as well as a base for any other organization.

On the other hand, the Feedback Token Pack goes a step further in the concept of **recognition**.
Thanks to it, we can value the influence capacity, the ability to build relationships and the leadership of our colleagues and employees.

Finally, the Incentives Plus Token Pack is aimed at **streamlining the way we reward** our employees. Both with financial and non-financial rewards, as well as by involving staff in our CSR policies.
