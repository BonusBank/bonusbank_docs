## 5 Types of Token. 5 Ways to Drive Change

The **Initial BonusBank Token Package** consists of **5 Token types**. They are the foundation from which multiple versions can be generated based on the interests, methodologies or realities of the organizations using them. Essentially, each one of them is represented in BonusBank by a name and an icon. The 5 Token types of the initial token pack are the following:

Each **Token**, within the application, comes with a short description to quickly understand its function, purpose, and what it measures. The descriptions of the 5 listed **Tokens** are:

- **Recognition Token**. **Connect** with your employees, colleagues and teams and create a close-knit community. With these Tokens you can map the social environment.
- **Expertise Token**. Reward those who share the **essential skills and values** of your business. Because it matters not only how much we do, but also **how** we **do it**.
- **CSR Token**. These tokens allow us to make **donations** to those organizations that need it most. **Being responsible together** and engaging in **social** action has never been easier.
- **Bonus Token**. Continuously reward every effort and **compensate** your teams or managers in a timely manner with **bonuses, participations**... You decide how and when.
- **Profit Token. Share profits on a regular basis** with your teams, according to the effort of each person or team and the periodicity you define. Make everyone part of the success.

To better understand it, we will briefly explain below **how** each of the **Tokens** individually **works**, **what they measure** and **when should be used**:

### Recognition

The **recognition Tokens** are kind of a “social Token”. It responds to a number of interests of companies, in particular: "peer-to-peer recognition", promoting **team work**, or being able to build trust between all kinds of professionals from different countries (ever more important in the current context of teleworking in which we live).

Essentially, the Recognition Tokens are characterized by the fact that they can be sent and received by anyone within the organization, and that they keep on circulating within BonusBank: it does not matter how many you have, but how many you receive and give away!

With these **tokens** we can create a positive and familiar, human work environment. We recommend making these types of tokens part of your space in BonusBank from the start, especially if you are not only interested in monetary incentives or bonuses (Hard Tokens). You won't regret it!

### Expertise

<img src={require('./img/expertise-cards.png').default} alt="drawing" width="200"/>

The **Expertise Tokens** are a kind of Token used for profile building: they make it possible to measure the **skills** or **soft skills** of employees on an individual or team level.

Thanks to the Expertise Tokens, **evaluations** (which are carried out quarterly, semi-annually, annually…) get more support from **objective and continuous data**, which shows not only how hard the teams or individuals have worked, but also **how they have done**. This makes it possible to measure the contribution and quality of everyone's work; and everyone gets to see how they're doing through a method designed to improve a person´s capabilities and surpass oneself.

The Expertise Tokens also help employees build **a personal profile that will allow** us to obtain various badges or awards and to develop a virtual CV. It helps the company to understand the skills of each person and which projects or teams a person would fit into more quickly and comfortably.

While they tend to have a more profile/social focus, Expertise Tokens can be exchanged for Hard Tokens, which represent a monetary value under certain conditions, if the organization so the wishes.

The Expertise Tokens, unlike the Recognition tokens, flow in **one-way** as they are usually transferred by managers to individual team members or to the entire team. We recommend implementing these Expertise tokens immediately at the start as they can facilitate **personal and professional improvement** and allow for the development of more complete and fair assessments. Of course, as mentioned, they can also be linked to hard tokens.

Remember that the personalized versions of Recognition Tokens that are created for you can reflect your own values ​​and parameters that you find important to measure. The power of the imagination!

### CSR

<img src={require('./img/csr.png').default} alt="drawing" width="400"/>

These are **tokens** with a more social responsibility **component** even though they are usually linked to a **monetary value** for which they can be exchanged. This is to make a **donation to non-profit organizations** or to entities that need help.

The logic we propose for **CSR tokens** is somewhat peculiar: while they could be sent directly to a beneficiary, like any other type of token, we recommend that they are sent either via challenges (a kind of transfer available in BonusBank that allows us to "challenge someone to achieve a goal” and once they achieve it, the promised tokens will be released in their account). Or they could be transferred as a joint reward for other tokens after completing a task or performing an outstanding action. The challenges make employees feel that they have earned the tokens and not just received them when they decide the beneficiary.

At **BonusBank** we are committed to involving all companies and their users in **Corporate Social Responsibility**. For this, we have devised these Tokens so that companies can distribute part (or all) of the budget for corporate giving among their teams and professionals. When the moment of giving comes, they are the ones who can decide which organizations the tokens they have earned over the year go to. In this way, the company motivates its staff and democratizes corporate social responsibility as its employees are aware of the importance and value of the actions they have taken during the year.

It must be said that the presented mechanism (challenges) is not the only way to use this token. The possibilities are endless and it can be customized according to the realities of any organization.

The **flow** of CSR Tokens, like that of Expertise tokens, is **one-way**, from a manager or team leader to the corresponding teams or employees and from them to the organization they choose (usually from a list defined by their company). Therefore, there is no circular logic like Recognition Tokens, although it is a Type Token that is distributed **in two steps**.

The use of these tokens is only recommended for those organizations that have a CSR policy or make donations and want to involve some or all of their teams. Therefore, it is not a token type that we recommend implementing from the start unless that is the case. You know: with CSR Tokens... being socially responsible and social together has never been easier!

### Bonus

The **Bonus Tokens** are a clear example of Hard Tokens: linked to **financial incentives and rewards**, they are a very useful way to honour and geige the effort and performance of the team and individual employees throughout the year.

These tokens follow the **one-way logic of** the CSR and Recognition, but with the difference that the recipient is usually a smaller group of **middle and senior management**. This is because their value has to do with compensation or bonuses for specific achievements, goals reached, and the reward can be money or even a share in the company.

Using the Bonus Tokens makes it possible to reward effort at the right time and to compensate the teams and/or their members in a timely manner. It fosters a **culture of personal commitment** and gives the company more flexibility in deciding how and when the bonus is awarded\*.

In addition, bonuses can motivate positive change by implementing a unique BonusBank functionality: **the exchange of Soft Tokens for Bonus Tokens**. That is, teams or employees collect different Soft Tokens (expertise, recognition, etc.) that can, under certain conditions, be exchanged for Hard Tokens. For example, upon reaching a certain combination and amount of Soft Tokens, and/or at a certain date (the quantity of each soft token needed and moment of exchange can be determined by each organization itself). In this way, employees not only build a digital profile and gain insight into how they can improve themselves, but they also receive a small bonus throughout the year in the form of tokens that can be exchanged, for example once a year. for cash or premiums.

<sup><sup>\* In order to avoid tax consequences each time a Token of this type is received, they are defined as conditional. In other word, their value will only become effective after the fulfillment of a condition or event (for example: completion of a challenge, end of a set period, closing a financing round, etc.).</sup></sup>

### Profit

The fifth and last of the Token types that are part of the Initial BonusBank Token Package is the **Profit Token**. This assumes the periodic sharing of company profits with some or all of the teams. This token enables the continuous distribution of the quarterly, semi-annual or annual profit to people who deserve it, and assign an estimated value to it each time. Thus, each of the professionals who are part of the organization can see how their work impacts their profit share and the company's overall profit.

These tokens make profit sharing tangible on a daily basis and not just at the end of the year; after the fact. In addition, for each team member they provide insight about the relationship between their efforts and the rewards they receive once or twice a year, as well as the health of the company and how it directly affects them.

The **use and essence** of this type of Tokens is similar to that of Bonus Tokens; with the difference that they usually **reach all employees**, because the idea is to use a simple merit-based mechanism to let everyone participate in the joint achievements and successes (without the need for a Soft-Hard conversion, although that can also be applied with this type of token) .

Unless a company is not interested in distributing monetary incentives of any kind, we encourage you to implement Profit Tokens right away. This is because they provide a good balance with the recognition and expertise tokens, and this way all 3 dimensions of the contribution people make to the company can be measured.
