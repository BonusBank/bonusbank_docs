# Batch Transfers

<p align="center"> Here we'll explain how transfers can be made using the dashboard. </p>

## Transfers in Dashboard

Just like in the app, you can make **transfers** from the Dashboard. **As a manager**, from the dashboard you'll be able to send various Tokens and select the employees that you think they deserve them, with just **one click**.

### Selecting the Plan

The first step in order to make a transfer, is to **select one of the Plans** that are active. If you need to create a new Plan, you can always go to the Plans tab and create one. The plans will be displayed as cards and they will display **the name**, **the current round finish date** and **the active Tokens**. Just select one to **continue**.

### Token and Feedback

Now we are at the screen where you actually **make the transfer**. In the left panel, you can **select the Tokens** you want to send from the ones that are active in your Plan. In the right panel, your **current plan** will be displayed and the **members** of it. You can select which recognition or incentives you send for each member.

Once you have all this figured out, you just need to click the **"Send Transfers" button** and a confirmation prompt will pop-up. Here you can check your transfer and make sure everything is okay. If it's ready, you can **send it**!

And that's how we can make **transfers** from the Dashboard!
