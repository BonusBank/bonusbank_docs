# The Dashboard

<p align="center"> The Dashboard is the analytical tool that will allow you to see important metrics and statistics. </p>

## What is the Dashboard?

Welcome to the **Dashboard**! This is the tool for the **managers**. Here you'll be able to send tokens, define targets, create plans and manage your teams, spaces and members as in the app. In the Dashboard you'll also be able to do a very important task... **to analyze, check the metrics and the statistics of your team!**

The dashboard distribution consists in a drawer at the left with its **principal features** and a central panel which displays the tabs selected at the drawer.

Your **user and your space** will be displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.

**Let's take a look at the Dashboard tabs!**
