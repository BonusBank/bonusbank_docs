# Screen IV: Profile

<p align="center">What is my BonusBank profile? What does it contain? How does it work? Keep reading and you will find the answers to these questions.</p>

### The profile and what it means

The **profile** is one of the four fundamental screens of the App, on which we **can view and update our data**, get an **historical overview** of sent and received view transfers and track our **performance**.

The profile consists of 3 important elements:

- **Personal data**. We can see and change our picture, as well as our **name, phone number, email** and **description**. In addition, it is possible to activate or deactivate the reception of **notifications via push or via email**. Our picture, phone number, email and description are visible to the rest of the members we share Teams and Spaces with.
- **Historical overview**. It is a relevant part of our profile and where we can see all the **details** of the **transfers**, made or received, in **chronological order**. This way, we can retrieve any feedback, view each amount received or see the history of transfers with a specific user.
- **Performance.** This functionality consists of a screen where we can see how well we are doing personally and as a team thanks to the Goals we complete, the amount of Tokens we receive of each type and other parameters with which we earn **badges** and generate a personal or team talent profile.

### What does the profile look like

What better than an example where we see all this in one image to better understand it?

<p align="center"><img src={require('./img/bbprofile.png').default} alt="drawing" width="250"/></p>

The **top part** of our Profile shows **data** that is also visible to other users. The only information that we cannot directly see here is the activation of the reception of notifications via push and via email. We can find this via the edit button (pencil next to the profile picture). The rest of the information is visible at a glance.

The first information that appears is the **historical overview**. It is structured in cards where we can see same day transfers grouped together and arranged chronologically. On the **left we see** the **picture** and the **name** of the **counterpart**, with the corresponding action (transfer, distribution as leader...) and with which we can know whether we are acting as senders or receivers. On the **right side** you´ll find the **number of tokens** sent and the **type of Token** in question. As you may have noticed, there are no ‘red numbers' at BonusBank, and sending Tokens is a positive action! For this reason, when we receive tokens, the number appears with a "+" in front of it and in green and when we send them, it appears in brackets and in blue. Easy right?

Finally, the **performance part**. For now, we can't tell you much, but we assure you that you will love it and you will not stop checking it to see the badges that you can collect thanks to your actions.

And so far the 4 info items related to the main screens of the App. Do not hesitate to consult our info items if you do not remember something!
